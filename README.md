# About Terminal-Simplifier
This program aims to simplify use of the terminal for those with little to no experience using the terminal. In many operating systems, the terminal is always seen as the most "hacky"- several commands can destroy your OS and ruin your computer. In reality, however, the terminal is an extremely simple element in your OS and can greatly increase your productivity if used correctly. In order to use the terminal to its full potential however, you would _usually_ have to learn several commands. By using terminal-simplifier, there's no need to learn the commands- you can let the computer do it all for you. 

Installing this program may seem tricky, but by using the installation guide below, you can have the program up and running in only 10-15 minutes. Once you have it installed, that's it! The terminal is at your command- from productivity commands to playing games, you can do nearly everything with this program. To get started with the installation guide below, open the terminal (**Ctrl+Alt+T** in most cases).
