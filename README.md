# About This Program

This program aims to increase the use and productivity of the terminal for those who are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with using the terminal. By running this program, a user (who may be uncomfortable using a terminal) has easier access to automated processes without typing any commands themselves. 

# Installation Purposes

This program can be installed on all major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and most major Linux distributions (Debian and Arch-based distros, as well as Fedora, centOS, and other SUSE-based distros). The flexibility of this project allows for nearly everyone to become more familiar with processes in their terminal, one of the most powerful tools on a PC. This program is also extremely well-optimized and doesn't use many resources, meaning it can run on older and slower machines. 

For many, the terminal can seem "hacky" and can mess up processes in your PC. This project aims to mitigate that fear and allow users to become more familiar with their terminals, as well as allow ease-of-access for nearly anyone who needs to use their terminal. Using automated processes in Python, this program can do nearly anything on the terminal with minimal input from the user. Furthermore, with new features being added rapidly, the capabilities of this program are expanding and being updated to work with the newest versions of supported operating systems.
